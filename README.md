# Machine Learning Algorithms

## About
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms that I have learned and practiced. The goal is to understand the fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch and applying them to real-world datasets.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees**: For classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees for more accurate predictions.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the best hyperplane to separate classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based classification algorithm.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into clusters.
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
  [git clone(https://github.com/Syed-Mansoor/machine_learning_.git]

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
